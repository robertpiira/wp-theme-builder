# wp-theme-builder
Minimal wp theme builder with webpack

Sass / ES6 out of the box!

## Organization

This starter kit uses `src`, `build`, and `dist` folders to organize theme development:

* `src`: this directory contains the raw material for your theme: templates (`src/`), PHP includes (`src/inc`), language files (`src/languages`), styles (`src/styles`), scripts (`src/scripts`), and images (anywhere under `src/`). **Only edit files in this directory!**
* `build`: generated by Webpack, this is a *working copy* of your theme for use in development and testing. You will need to manually run `npm run build` or `npm run start`. Symlink `build` to your `wp-content/themes` directory for local development and testing (e.g. if your theme is in `~/dev/themes/my-theme` and your local copy of WordPress is installed in `~/dev/localhost/wp` you'll want to run `ln -s ~/dev/themes/my-theme/build ~/dev/localhost/wp/wp-content/themes/my-theme`).
* `dist`: this will be the final, minified copy of your theme for production. You will need to manually run `npm run dist` to create a new distribution. You can also symlink this directory for a final round of testing; just keep in mind that your theme will now be in `dist/[project]`. This project folder is what you will want to deploy to production.
